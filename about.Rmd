title: "Who am I?"
description: |
  I graduated with a PhD in Civil Engineering with a focus on smart cities from University of Illinois at Chicago, I was advised by Dr. Sybil Derrible, Director of the Complex and Sustainable Urban Networks Laboratory at UIC. My PhD research was on urban intelligence, which is a machine leraning based decision support framework to help policymakers in developing sustainable policies. My research interests are sustainable transportation, Natural Language Processing, Cuasal Inference, Machine Learning. Apart from my research, I also like to dabble in other projects in order to develop my machine learning and problem solving skills. This blog will a home to some of my opinions and side projects.
