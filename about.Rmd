title: "Who am I?"
description: |
  I am a postdoc doing research in Electric Vehicles (EVs). Particularly, I am interested in understanding the effects of EVs on travel behavior, traffic safety, road capacity, energy consumption, etc. I rely on statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and simulation to model and study the EVs' effects. 
  
  I have a PhD in Civil Engineering with a focus on smart cities from University of Illinois at Chicago. I was advised by Dr. Sybil Derrible, Director of the Complex and Sustainable Urban Networks Laboratory at UIC. During my PhD, I developed a machine learning based decision support framework called **urban intelligence** to help policymakers in developing smart sustainable policies. Apart from my research, I like to learn new techniques. This blog will be a home for some of my analyses and projects.
