title: "Who am I?"
description: |
  My name is Mohamed Badhrudeen. I am a PhD student doing research in Smart Cities, specifically focusing on urban intelligence. Urban intelligence is a process of leveraging data intelligently to recommend an action towards solving some of the urban challenges. Apart from my research I like to dabble in other projects in order to develop my problem solving skills. I will be posting some of my side projects here.
